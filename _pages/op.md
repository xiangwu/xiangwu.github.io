ASIR Open Platform (ASIR OP) is a hierarchical collection of open source projcet, which inlcudes both learning-based projects(ASIR-SE) and innovative-based project(ASIR-GURU), plus a practical tool-set(ASIR-Helper). 

## ASIR-SE (Study Environment)
### ROSE

ROSE(Robotics Study Environment) is a learning and simulation Environment based on Matlab and CoppeliaSim, includes the sources of three main online open course with matierials, exercises.
And an algorithm collection fromm ASIR and other researcher or organizer haved published.
