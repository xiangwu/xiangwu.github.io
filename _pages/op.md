# ASIR-GURU
ASIR Open Platform is a hierarchical collection of open source projcet, which is called **ASIR-GURU**. 
It inlcudes two learning-based projects, two innovative-based projects, and a practical tool-set. 

## ROSE
Robotics Study Environment(ROSE) is a learning and simulation Environment based on Matlab and CoppeliaSim, includes the sources of three main online open course with matierials, exercises.
And an algorithm collection fromm ASIR and other researcher or organizer haved published. 

The open source page of **ROSE** is [here](https://github.com/xiangwu/ROSE) 

The main courses can be found at
- RO-1 Robotics Premier: Modeling and Trajectory Planning [here](/teaching/ro1-2025)
- RO-2 Robotics Motion: Dynamics and Control. [here](/teaching/ro1-2025)
- RO-3 Control Engineering Practice [here]()
  
## VISE
Visual Information Study Environment(VISE) is a learning and test platform for image processing and computer vision relative alogrithms. It also includes 3 main courses and an algorithm collection.
